# Contribution Guidelines

This guide is for Mode Tech-Cooperators. We appreciate your efforts in enhancing the Mode ecosystem.

Here's how it works:

- Add your suggestions to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/).
- We'll review and either add it to the [Task Board](taskboard) or decline it.
- You get to pick a task you want to start working on from the [Task Board](taskboard).
- Raise a PR once done following the PR template.
- We'll review and either give you feedback or approve your submision.

## Issues

Once you start working on a task, please let others know by assigning the task to yourlself, this helps others understand what is being worked on so they don't pick it again. 

- Check out the [Issues tab](https://github.com/) for some contribution suggestions made by anyone including Mode's core team.
- If an issue gets added to the [Task Board](taskboard), that means the Mode team would love for this Issue to be worked on.

## Approval Process

We want to keep quality high so here's how approval works:

- After you open a PR, we'll mark it with `In Review`.

- Once your contribution gets the thumbs up, it's merged.
